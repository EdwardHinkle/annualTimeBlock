# Annual Time Block

_Coming Soon_

This is a web-based version of [Michael Hyatt's Excel spreadsheet](http://michaelhyatt.com/creating-an-annual-time-block.html) for planning out your entire year in one viewing. It uses Google Calendar as the data storage, which allows you to login to this tool, view your entire year plan in a single view, and then when you go into your day-to-day living, all of your information is already in your google calendar.
